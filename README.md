## Proposal:

Passive customer is one of the biggest challenges for any organization. A passive customer is one who has not searched for information regarding the company and is not involved in any activities. The likelihood of a passive customer switching to a competitor is more than that of an active customer. The goal of this project is to detect any potential passive customers of Starbucks depending on their activity related to the rewards offered. The dataset will contain the profile information of the customer, rewards information for a month and the reward details send to customers as well as their action on the same. Preprocessing of data might be required to handle missing values and to combine the data. A target indicator field can be created to denote if the customer is passive or not depending on the activity of the customer on the reward data. For example, old customers who have not acted upon their offers are most likely to be passive. Other features/indicators can also be used to determine this. Explore the data and use atleast two machine learning models to fit the data. Students must use model evaluation methods to find the most optimal solution.
